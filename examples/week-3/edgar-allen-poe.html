          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Edgar Allan Poe</b> (born Edgar Poe;
            <time datetime="1809-01-19">January 19, 1809</time> &ndash;
            <time datetime="1849-10-07">October 7, 1849</time>) was an American
            writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his
            poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the
            macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in
            the United States and of American literature as a whole, and he was
            one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. He
            is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre
            and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of
            science fiction.<sup>1</sup> He was the first well-known American
            writer to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a
            financially difficult life and career.<sup>1</sup>
          </p>

          <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p>
            Poe was born in Boston, the second child of actors David and
            Elizabeth "Eliza" Arnold Hopkins Poe.<sup>3</sup> His father
            abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died the following
            year. Thus orphaned, the child was taken in by John and Frances
            Allan of Richmond, Virginia. They never formally adopted him, but he
            was with them well into young adulthood. Tension developed later as
            John Allan and Edgar Poe repeatedly clashed over debts, including
            those incurred by gambling, and the cost of Poe's secondary
            education. He attended the University of Virginia but left after a
            year due to lack of money. Edgar Poe quarreled with John Allan over
            the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under
            an assumed name, <s>Edward J. Crumplestiltskin</s> (this has been
            debunked, see <sup>3</sup>)
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Writing</h3>
          <p>
            It was at this time that his publishing career began with the
            anonymous collection <i>Tamerlane and Other Poems</i> (<time
              datetime="1827"
              >1827</time
            >), credited only to "a Bostonian". Edgar Poe and John Allan reached
            a temporary rapprochement after the death of Frances Allan in 1829.
            Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point, declaring a firm
            wish to be a poet and writer, and he ultimately parted ways with
            John Allan. Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next
            several years working for literary journals and periodicals,
            becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work
            forced him to move among several cities, including Baltimore,
            Philadelphia, and New York City. He married his 13-year-old cousin,
            Virginia Clemm, in 1836. In January 1845, Poe published his poem
            "The Raven" to instant success, but Virginia died of tuberculosis
            two years after its publication. Poe planned for years to produce
            his own journal <i>The Penn</i>(later renamed <i>The Stylus</i>),
            but he died before it could be produced.

            <h4>The Raven</h4>
            <p>
              Poe's most famous work is "The Raven". Here is the first stanza:
            </p>
            <blockquote
              cite="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven"
            >
              Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br />
              Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br />
              While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br />
              As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br />
              “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br />
              Only this and nothing more.”

            <h4>Invented words</h4>
            <p>
              Poe, like Shakespeare, invented a number of words in his writing.
              Here is a list of words and their definitions:

          <h3>Death</h3>
          <p>
            On <time datetime="1849-10-03">October 3, 1849</time>, Poe was found
            delirious on the streets of Baltimore,
            <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe"
              >in great distress, and... in need of immediate assistance</q
            >, according to Joseph W. Walker who found him.<sup>5</sup> He was
            taken to the Washington Medical College where he died on
            <time datetime="1849-10-07T09:00:00.000Z"
              >Sunday, October 7, 1849 at 5:00 in the morning</time
            >.<sup>6</sup> He was not coherent long enough to explain how he
            came to be in his dire condition and, oddly, was wearing clothes
            that were not his own. He is said to have repeatedly called out the
            name "Reynolds" on the night before his death, though it is unclear
            to whom he was referring. Some sources say that Poe's final words
            were <q>Lord help my poor <em>soul</em></q
            >.<sup>7</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            All medical records have been lost, including his death certificate.
            Newspapers at the time reported Poe's death as "congestion of the
            brain" or "cerebral inflammation", common euphemisms for death from
            disreputable causes such as alcoholism. The actual cause of death
            remains a mystery. Speculation has included delirium tremens, heart
            disease, epilepsy, chemical poisoning (large traces of
            C​<sub>8​</sub>H​<sub>10​</sub>N​<sub>4​</sub>O​<sub>2</sub> were
            found in Poe's bloodstream), syphilis, meningeal inflammation,
            cholera, and rabies.

          <h3>Legacy</h3>
          <p>
            Poe and his works influenced literature around the world, as well as
            specialized fields such as cosmology and cryptography. He and his
            work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films,
            and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today.
            The Mystery Writers of America present an annual award known as the
            Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre.
